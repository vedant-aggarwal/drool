/**
 * A16 (A14-1a), Windows counter-check 02.09.: the rename to "LU Engine" held
 * everywhere the counter-check looked in 2.6.8, with one leftover it could
 * name: "Cannot reach the built-in embeddings server." That sentence is about
 * the embeddings sidecar rather than the chat engine, so it slipped past the
 * checklist, and standing next to "LU Engine" everywhere else it simply reads
 * as a second product.
 *
 * This is the sweep that keeps the next one from slipping through. It reads
 * every source file the app ships, throws the comments away, and fails on any
 * remaining "built-in" in text that can reach a user, a log line included.
 *
 * Second pass, same counter-check: the first version of this sweep only knew
 * "built-in engine" and "built-in embeddings", and the rename it was guarding
 * was not finished. It missed "Create built-in models dir", "already exists in
 * the built-in models folder", "Could not link the model into the built-in
 * folder", "Starting built-in llama-server", "Built-in embeddings server
 * healthy", "the built-in /v1/embeddings endpoint" and "Could not resolve the
 * built-in models directory." Two reasons: the pattern stopped at two nouns,
 * and the Rust side, where half of those live, was never read at all. Both are
 * fixed here.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered:
 *   - `release-notes.ts`. Notes for 2.6.7 and older describe the app as it was
 *     called then, and rewriting history there would make the notes lie.
 *   - `lib/engine-name.ts`. It holds the old display name on purpose:
 *     `LEGACY_ENGINE_NAME` is what sits in provider configs written before
 *     2.6.8, and `isLuEngineName` has to keep recognising it.
 *   - The legacy matcher in `commands/download.rs`, for the same reason one
 *     step further down: those spellings are what older callers send, so the
 *     old name IS the data there.
 *   - Code identifiers (`isBuiltinEngineEntry`, `builtin_*`, `activateBuiltinModel`).
 *     They are not text on a screen and renaming them would be a large diff
 *     with no reader.
 *   - Other things that are genuinely built in: ComfyUI's own nodes and VAEs,
 *     LU's built-in workflows and personas, the built-in HTTP server behind
 *     Remote Access. Those keep the adjective because it is true of them, and
 *     the pattern below is deliberately narrow enough to walk past them.
 *
 * Limit worth knowing: the comment stripper is a regular expression, not a
 * parser. It can swallow the tail of a string containing `//`, so the sweep can
 * miss a hit hidden behind a URL inside a literal. It cannot invent one.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/lib/__tests__/no-built-in-engine-left-on-screen.test.ts
