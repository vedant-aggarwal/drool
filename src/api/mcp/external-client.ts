  /**
   * Take the server process down — the whole tree, not just the shim (T-68).
   *
   * The one place this client kills anything. Both callers (a failed handshake
   * in `connect()`, and `disconnect()`) used to run `this.child.kill()`
   * themselves, and that call is NOT a tree kill:
   * `tauri-plugin-shell`'s `CommandChild::kill` is one signal to the DIRECT
   * child (`src/process/mod.rs:78`). An MCP server started as `npx -y <pkg>`
   * — or `npx.cmd` through cmd.exe on Windows — has the launcher as that
   * direct child and the real `node` server as a GRANDCHILD. Killing the shim
   * reaped the launcher and left the server running for the rest of the
   * session, unreachable: the JS handle was gone with it.
   *
   * ── The ordering is the whole point ─────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `kill_process_tree` is called INSTEAD of `child.kill()`, never after it.
   * The Rust guard (`may_kill_pid`) only allows pids inside this app's own
   * subtree, and that is exactly what the direct child's death destroys: the
   * moment the launcher exits, its children are reparented to init, stop being
   * our descendants, and the guard refuses — correctly, and too late. Kill the
   * shim first and the tree kill can no longer reach anything.
   *
   * The tree kill covers the direct child too (`kill_pid_tree`'s snapshot
   * includes the root), so nothing is left for a follow-up kill to do. Not
   * calling the plugin's own `kill` command also does not strand the pid in
   * its child map: the plugin removes an entry when it sees `Terminated`
   * (`src/commands.rs:259`), which is what the tree kill causes.
   *
   * ── When the command is not there or says no ────────────────────────────
   *
   * Two ways to land in the fallback, both real: a Rust side older than
   * `c5773322` has no such command, and the guard refuses a pid that is not
   * ours — which happens when the process already exited on its own, so its
   * pid is not in this app's subtree any more. In both the alternative to
   * `child.kill()` is leaving a server process running, i.e. exactly the
   * pre-T-53 bug; so we fall back and say so in the log. What the fallback
   * can lose is grandchildren — the leak this method exists to close — and
   * nothing beyond that.
   *
   * Outside Tauri there is no IPC to ask, and no MCP server either: the spawn
   * goes through the shell plugin, which needs the same IPC. The check is
   * synchronous on purpose, so the no-Tauri case does not pay for a dynamic
   * import (a page-unload sweep is counted in ticks) and does not log a
   * warning about a tree kill nobody could have wanted.
   *
   * Best-effort throughout: `disconnect()` is reached from a page-unload sweep
   * where a rejection is an unhandled one.

 * es nie gab.
 *
 * Am 05.09.2026 fiel ein zweiter Ausweg derselben Sorte auf, diesmal von einem
 * Tester, der die App zum ersten Mal bediente. Der Ersatzsatz sagte "Change the
 * command to one of those". Aendern konnte man aber nichts: die Zeile trug
 * genau zwei Knoepfe, "Connect" und "Remove server", und Klick, Doppelklick
 * und Rechtsklick auf Name oder Befehl oeffneten kein Eingabefeld. Wer sich
 * vertippt hatte, musste loeschen und alles neu eintippen.
 *
 * Statt den Satz um die Luecke herumzuschreiben ist die Luecke geschlossen:
 * `updateServer` lag im Store bereits fertig und getestet und wurde von
 * nirgends gerufen. `MCPServerSettings` hat jetzt einen "Edit server"-Knopf,
 * der genau darauf geht. Der Rat stimmt damit wieder.
 *
 * Und das Beispiel `npx -y your-mcp-package` war ein Platzhaltername. Wer ihm
 * woertlich folgte, bekam "Server process exited", ohne Hinweis darauf, dass
 * das Paket gar nicht existiert. Die Meldung fuehrte in eine zweite, schlechtere.
 * Jetzt nennt sie ein Paket, das wirklich startet: `uvx mcp-server-time` wurde
 * am 05.09. auf der Windows-Box gefahren und lieferte zwei Werkzeuge.
